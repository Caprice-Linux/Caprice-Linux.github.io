title: Caprice Linux 1.0-STABLE is almost finished!
---

It's a week since the last post. In this post, I actually give you some good news about _Caprice Linux_ and her process of development. Now, we chose a code name, we have a community forum and we also have a wiki! 

## Code name : Atmora

I'm a big fan of _The Elder Scrolls_ games. I even had references from the games, specially the fifth version __Skyrim__ in my daily life. Sometimes, I even said _Thanks Talos_ instead of saying _Thanks God_. It's all because I spent a lot of time in playing the game and it still has something to surprise me. So, _Atmora_ is from the Elder Scrolls franchise. 

If you play the games, you will understand that most of the game happens in a continent called _Tamriel_ and the names such as _Morrowind_ or _Skyrim_ are provinces of this continent. But there is an icy continent in north of Tamriel which is home to Nords, a group of humans now living in Tamriel. As Atmora gets colder and colder, they try to find a new land. They just start their journey through the sea and find Skyrim. They make cities and holds in the province. It's a long story, and you can find the reason behind this naming [here](http://wiki.capricelinux.org/doku.php?id=1_0_stable_atmora).

## Wiki and Forums

A good project always have a place to find the documentations or even contribute to the documentations. This is why I installed a wiki management system on one of _Caprice Linux_ servers! The wiki is accessible using [this link](http://wiki.capricelinux.org). And of course, although we have something like `capricelinux:mozilla.org` on _Matrix_ or [Caprice Linux Chat](https://t.me/caprice_chat) on _Telegram_, but forums are for more trustable. So I also installed a forum management system and the forums are accessible through [this link](https://community.capricelinux.org) as well! 

From now on, we have pretty much everything a project needed. So the focus will be on the release process of the project! 

## Final Release details 

We'll have a release very soon. The final release requires a lot of things. I just list a few of them here : 

* A guide on `pkgsrc` for people who prefer _The BSD Way_. 
* A guide on installing _services_ using `pkgsrc` and get its init system to work. 
* Creation of `memestick` image, it's done once and it was working really well. But there was a few changes in the main file system. So, it should be made again. 
* Uploading images! I personally live in a place with really shitty connection. My previous home was better because I had an LTE connection. But in this home I don't have any faster connection than my ADSL. So, It will take at least 2 days for two images to be uploaded. 

I can't give you an exact release date. But by the August, you can install _Caprice Linux_ and celebrate your very new operating system.
