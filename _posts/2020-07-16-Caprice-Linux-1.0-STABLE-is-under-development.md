title: Caprice Linux 1.0-STABLE is under development (2020/16/07)
---

There was a hope to have the final release of _Caprice Linux 1.0-STABLE_ by the month of July, but something went a bit out of control and then, the development process went a bit slower. I really wanted to write this devlog in a more appropriate time to just tell you the __development__ process.  The _Iranian FLOSS community_ (I promise, one of the most passive communities in the world) just started doubting that _Caprice Linux_ is government funded. This article is more about clarifications about the releationship between _Caprice Linux_ and Iranian government. 

## Funds and helps

_Caprice Linux_ got a lot of help from __community__, and not the government or any government-funded company. The _Caprice Community_ is much bigger than Iranian FLOSS community as a lot of my friends from all around the world help me in the process. 

But about helps, the only help we got was a server. It's not actually from the government by the way. It's actually a server for [Sana Desktop](http://sanaos.ir), a GNU+Linux based desktop operating system I worked on (and it became one of my biggest regrets) for a private corporation. The server used to be a _mirror_ for Sana Desktop and I only asked my friends at work about how I can use it. They gave me the permission to host _Caprice Linux_ repository on that server. This is the only thing we have from a company or corporation and _Caprice Linux_ is not _national_ operating system or something like that. 

## Development Process

Past week, I sent the secret key to my plain of Oblivion to some of my friends. Actually, It was a link to `1.0-STABLE`. It had some bugs and problems and I even couldn't install the damn thing on my oldass HP laptop easily. 

I listed those errors and problems, so I will check them out and solve them with the help of a lot of powerful developers in _Caprice Community_. The final release will be ready in a week or two.
