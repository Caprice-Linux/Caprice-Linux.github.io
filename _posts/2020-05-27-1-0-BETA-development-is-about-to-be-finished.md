title: 1.0-BETA development is about to be finished.
---

I come back to say, I'm happy to announce that development process of the version `1.0-BETA` is finished. But unfortunately, it's not. _Caprice Linux_ is one of my most personal projects. Although one of my biggest successes of all time was building the community, it's still a personal thing to do. So, I decided to spend the time when I have enough joy and courage. It doesn't mean there will be years of these stupid blog posts or something similar before a real release! No! The `1.0-BETA` version is actually completed. I personally want to do a bit of more experiments with what I made. 

Enough talking, and I even can see how much self-pity I put in the first paragraph. So, I have to say we have more important things to do with the project and all of them found a good routine. I also have say a big _thank you_ too most of my close friends, who helped the project grow and they still help this project! No doubt of that, I couldn't make this piece of art without their help!

Let's make long stories short. I have to make some announcements about the `1.0-BETA` version and what I got in past few days. Surprising and great news are coming. 

## Repositories 

Now, I request the big band to play a nice jazz piece. I want to say my friends at _Free software assosication of Iran_ (or FLOSSIR for short) were nice enough to let me use one of their servers to host _Caprice Linux_ repositories. I set that repositories become update each Saturday at 00:00 UTC. And it's a great starting point for our project! 

Repositories are accessible now. I prefer to surprise you when I declare the official release of `1.0-BETA`. So do not expect me to give you the links to those repositories :P 

## Artwork

Ah! I had to design the damn logo myself. It wasn't hard. It's not really satisfying for me but I prefer to have a logo for the first release(s). We can work on that and even doing a re-brand in future.
