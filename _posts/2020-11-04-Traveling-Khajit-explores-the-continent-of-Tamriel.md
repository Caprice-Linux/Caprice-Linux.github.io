title: Traveling Khajit explores the continent of Tamriel
---

Before getting to the main subject, I explain a bit about _Khajit_. Khajit is a half-monster race in the realm of Tamriel from The Elder Scrolls. These people are like "Two-legged cat men". They're nomadic and they're cool! So we have a new project to announce! 

So what's the main subject? OK. Let's cool down, grab a glass of our favorite drink (I personally have a glass of Pepsi on my desk!) and just dig deep into this. In the past few months, I personally experienced some big changes in life. One of them was moving from GNU/Linux to Apple's macOS. Fine, it doesn't sound FLOSS at all, but I needed diversity in my life and it was the best thing I could do. But I never stopped using and developing Linux. I still use _Arvan Cloud_ (for those who don't know, it's the Iranian version of AWS) and most of my servers are still on Linux. I have installed _Caprice Enterprise Linux_ on a server and it will become a mirror for downloading ISO's. But I faced some problems as well! Let's count the problems. 

## Problems we have faced 

* __NVIDIA graphic cards__: I think Linus Torvalds is the best person to explain why this is a problem, but I'm not that rude. So, I explain : You can't easily enjoy power of your device and power of Debian GNU/Linux at the same time if you have one of these guys. So, this should be solved. At least it can help more people to get into the *nix world.
* __pkgsrc__: Fine. I finally give up on this one. It was a smashing success to have this baby as the extra package manager, but let's be honest, it was useless. I think getting something more serious and more useful can be more helpful! (Please don't install a _more counter_ here.)
* __XFCE__: No. This is not an end-user problem. This is my personal problem actually. Configuring it was not really easy. So we had to pivot to something other than XFCE. 

## Traveling Khajit, the solution! 

So, long story short. A newer version will be available with the name _Traveling Khajit_. This baby will be based on `stable` branch, but it will come with GNOME as the desktop environment and it also will be friendly with your NVIDIA graphics. There are a few tools I'm working on, for a better performance and better application/package management.
