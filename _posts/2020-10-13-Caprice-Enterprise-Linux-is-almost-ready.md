title: Caprice Enterprise Linux is almost ready
---

I expected things get a bit better by the end of September, but for now I really beg Billie Joe Armstrong to sing another song _Wake me up when October ends_. Why? I don't know. Maybe because the COVID-19 is getting worse again? I have no idea. 

But let's be honest, in this crazy time, we can help ourselves to feel a bit better and doing technical stuff is how I can help myself. In the whole time, almost two months, I was developing _Caprice Enterprise Linux_. The server edition of Caprice Linux, but with a little bit of difference between the community edition and enterprise edition. 

In the previous blog post, I started talking about the importance of the monetization of the project. There's no better way to monetize a linux distribution than having enterprise level support. There was some ideas and plans and I will explain them in the next couple of paragraphs.

## Caprice Enterprise Linux for workstations (aka Caprice Enterprise Desktop)

So, this was one of the very first implementations of the enterprise edition. It had Cinnamon desktop and a bunch of necessary applications for the daily use. But keeping in mind that we had a desktop project previously and it works and it's one the greatest projects I personally have done, we decided to drop this. 

And to be honest, at least in my region, people do not really like to leave Windows. Desktop Linux users here are usually geeky/nerdy people who love the concepts of POSIX, freedom of software, etc. Other people prefer Microsoft Windows or if they're a bit more fortunate, maybe macOS. So, instead of doing an awful lot of time-wasting jobs on making a workstation edition, we have dropped it. Now enterprise desktop.
