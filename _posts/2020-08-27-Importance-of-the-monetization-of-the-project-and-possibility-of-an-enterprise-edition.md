title: Importance of the monetization of the project and possibility of an enterprise edition
---

We all live in a world that made us earn money to get ourselves a life. No doubt of that. Of course, most of things we do are for money, if not all. In the past few months, I was paid for making a desktop-ready Debian based Linux distribution for _Persian-speaking_ users called [Sana Desktop](http://sanaos.ir). In parallel, I started _Caprice Linux_ as a hobby project and of course, a test ground for ideas I had for Sana Desktop. 

Now, conditions have been changed. I still collaborate with Sana. I'm not ashamed of being a part of a professional team who develop _Free/Libre Software_. At least, we're proud of being the developers of a piece of free software and not _Not having bash_ on our computers. Anyway, that collaboration is not monetized for now. We have been told that this will happen, so I'm not sad, mad or angry about that. 

But it made me think about my personal project, _Caprice Linux_. Of course this project will be alive as long as I can pay for servers and the domain we have. But I was thinking of the monetization of the project. In this article, there'll be a few ideas about monetization. 

## Ideas for monetization of the project 

Don't know if you have watched the movie _The Social Network_ by _David Fincher_, which shows us how one of our real-life evil technology companies came to existence. In one scene, _Mark Zuckerberg_ says : 

> Facebook is cool, but we still don't know what it is. 

I still have the same opinion about _Caprice Linux_. But let's be honest, the project has the chance to be monetized. So I list a few things in the list below : 

* __Support__: Of course having a professional support team helps. But it helps when the project is vastly used. For now, I don't even know how many people installed _Caprice Linux_ as their desktop operating system. 
* __Selling Merch__: It is a good idea. I still doubt it's helpfulness, but it's a way to advertise the project and make money at the same time. 
* __Donations__: We don't have any good donation platform which can cover _All people of the world_. We still may need PayPal or WebMoney for countries other than Iran, and using services like ZarinPal for people who live inside Iran. It just makes it a bit difficult. But if you want be a donor, let me know in the chat room or the community forums. 

These were the possible ways to monetize it as a normal hobby project, but something bigger came to my mind. I decided to write it in a separate section in this article! 

## Caprice Enterprise Linux 

A few weeks ago, I made a Debian GNU/Linux image, installed it on a virtual machine, made it cloud-ready and uploaded it to my panel on [Arvan Cloud](http://arvancloud.com) and it worked. I just simply called the image _Cloud Enterprise Linux_ and I had spoke to one of my greatest friends _Amirmohammad Kouyeshpour_, who currently leads _Ilam Linux Users Group_ (Ilam Lug for short) and he was positive about the project. 

It's a long time we haven't talked about this project but the conversations we had about an __enterprise__ solution, just made me think and even work hard to get an acceptable output for the project. There's a big possibility of having _Caprice Enterprise Linux_ in the near future. 

## What will happen to Caprice Linux (The desktop edition)? 

Nothing will happen to that baby. It's based on the _Debian Stable_ and it will be updated with the next stable release of the _Debian GNU/Linux_. Nothing will change. We will work on our desktop edition and it will be called _Caprice Linux Community_. As it's made by the help of a community of great people. 

Plans for _Caprice Linux Community_ will be published soon. Do not worry, we'll never give up on the desktop market.
