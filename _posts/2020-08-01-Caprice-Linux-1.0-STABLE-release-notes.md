title: Caprice Linux 1.0-STABLE "Atmora" Release Notes
---

A few hours prior to this post in the development blogs, I said _August 1st 2020 will be a historical day._ One of my friends thought I managed to find a cure for COVID-19 (I wish I could), or I found a way to prevent Trump from being elected again. But things are not going the ways we like! I still could make a historical way for you though, I did it by easily releasing my project, _Caprice Linux_. 

## Development Timeline 

Fine, as I knew it might be a good idea to have a development timeline, I put the [development timeline](http://wiki.capricelinux.org/doku.php?id=1_0_stable_atmora&s[]=1&s[]=0&s[]=stable&s[]=atmora#development_timeline) completely in the wiki. This post will be added to the wiki as soon as I push the final change to github. 

## Atmora, what's special? 

As I explained in the wiki as well as the previous post in this website, _Atmora_ is a fictional continent on the planet _Nirn_ and it's the birth place of _Nords_. Nords were a group of humans who traveled to _Tamriel_ and made the province of _Skyrim_ their new home. This is a reference to the Elder Scrolls lore. 

By the way, there something special in this release (and I personally put most of my effort to keep them alive for future releases): 

* Implementation of `pkgsrc` as a package/port management system in the distribution. 
* Trying to get rid of `systemd` as much as possible. Although we still kept `systemd`, but it can be easily ignored. (Just read _[A Hitchhiker's Guide to pkgsrc](http://wiki.capricelinux.org/doku.php?id=hitchhiker_guide_pkgsrc)_ in the wiki to find out how it works)
* Providing a better looking desktop session :

## Documents and Guidelines 

Although I really wanted to write installation guides before doing the `1.0-STABLE` release, I couldn't. I was too busy working on some projects and I couldn't spend enough time on writing some guides for _Caprice Linux_. By the way, the wiki new registrations will become open very soon and you people can help on writing new guides and tutorials on the wiki. Stay tuned! 

_Caprice Linux_ has a very straight forward installation process, if you have any difficulties, check the [forums](https://community.capricelinux.org) and ask a question. People will kindly answer your questions!

## Future of the project

This project will have future updates and releases, of course. I can't promise it would be a long-lasting project such as _Ubuntu_ or _Linux Mint_. But we developed a very good community. The community can easily help us get on top of the mountain. So, I personally am happy about what I did, not creation of _yet another linux distribution_, but for development of a great and lovely community. And as I said in the first days of the project, _Caprice Linux_ is _community driven_. So, I'm not the only developer. 30 other people are as well! 

I hope you have a great time using _Caprice Linux_ and let us know your opinion on _Caprice Linux_ using the [community](/links).
