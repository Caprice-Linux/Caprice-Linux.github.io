title: Minimal Caprice is the new child of the family
---

Although 2020 was a crazy year and still one month remains to give us more surprises, it wasn't very bad for me. _Caprice Linux_ was the project I've built in this crazy time and it had a lot of fun and benefits for me. For example, one of the most important events of this year for me, was creation of the _Caprice Linux Community_. A group of great people who helped the process of building a Linux distribution become as fast as possible. And now, I'm honored to announce a new child in our family! 

## The Minimal Caprice 

_Minimal_ in the world of Linux has a strong meaning. Minimal distributions are usually light-weight and suitable for old-ass computers. They usually do not have a big DE like GNOME or XFCE, they do not come with a ton of packages and they're not easy-to-install for a newbie user. But then, who will use those? I tell you, my friends and me. Why? because sometimes you need an environment to help you focus on what the hell you're doing and not bombarding you with un-needed announcements and notifications. Also, this is not the whole story. In past couple of months I was busy developung _Caprice Unified Base System_ (CUBS for short) as a system installer so we needed a version (other than our enterprise one) to test `cubs` out. This is a preview of _Minimal Caprice_ on my computer:

And as you can see, now it sucks less, at least in terms of the user interface.
